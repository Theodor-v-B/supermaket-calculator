# Supermarket Calculator

This project is a web-based tool designed to assist in determining the optimal pricing for products listed on Supermarket Together.

## Purpose

- It doubles the current market price.
- Then subtracts 0.01 to ensure the final price remains competitive and not excessively high.

The primary goal is to help sellers quickly estimate a balanced price point, simplifying the pricing process and ensuring prices stay attractive to customers while maintaining profitability.
